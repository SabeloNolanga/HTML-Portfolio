<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I was born and raised in the area called Inanda, a town just outside the city of Durban.
  I am a mechanical engineering student, that majoured in mechanical fitting. I am also a draughtsman in the 
  field of mechanical engineering.

<p>
  I am venturing into the field of computer science, particularly in the study of web development.
  This is not a matter of switching careers but expanding my horizons
