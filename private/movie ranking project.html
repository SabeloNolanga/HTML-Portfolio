 <h1>The Best Movies According to Mlondi</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
    <p>
        This is my favourate movie. it teaches great brotherhood and
        positive male masculinity.
    </p>

    <h3>Interstella</h3>
    <p>
        This is a great adventure movie for us space nerds. It also
        teaches us about the strong bond and love between father and daugher 
        that transcends space and time.
    </p>
    <h3>Shrek</h3>
    <p>
        This is one of the best animations of all time. Shrek, an ogre, along side 
        his new "bestie", Donkey, goes on an unintended avdenture in order to save 
        his swamp from the evil Lord Farquad.
